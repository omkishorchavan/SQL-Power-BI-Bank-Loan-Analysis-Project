# SQL-Power-BI-Bank-Loan-Analysis-Project


Welcome to the Bank Loan Analysis Power BI project repository! This project aims to provide insightful analysis and visualization of bank loan data using Power BI.

 SQL Work Summary (What We Did with SQL)
In this project, we used SQL to get important insights from the loan dataset before using Power BI for visualization.

 Here's what SQL helped us find:

Total Loan Applications: Counted how many people applied for loans.

Funded Amount: Found out how much money was given out as loans.

Amount Received: Checked how much money came back from borrowers.

Interest Rate & DTI: Calculated average interest rate and debt-to-income ratio to understand loan risks.

MTD & MoM Trends: Tracked loan activity month-to-date and compared it with the previous month.

Good vs Bad Loans: Found how many loans were repaid (good) and how many were not (bad).

Loan Status Summary: Grouped data by loan status like "Fully Paid", "Charged Off", and "Current".

State, Term, Purpose & Employment: Broke down data by region, loan length, reason for loan, and job experience.

## Overview

This Power BI project analyzes various aspects of bank loans to provide valuable insights for decision-making. It comprises three main dashboards: Summary, Overview, and Details.

### Dashboard 1: Summary

#### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements:

1. **Total Loan Applications:** Calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period, including Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.
2. **Total Funded Amount:** Understand the total amount of funds disbursed as loans, monitor MTD Total Funded Amount, and analyze MoM changes.
3. **Total Amount Received:** Track the total amount received from borrowers to assess cash flow and loan repayment, including MTD Total Amount Received and MoM changes.
4. **Average Interest Rate:** Calculate the average interest rate across all loans, MTD, and monitor MoM variations.
5. **Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):** Evaluate the average DTI for borrowers, compute the average DTI for all loans, MTD, and track MoM fluctuations.

#### Summary Visualization:

**Loan Status Grid View:** Gain a comprehensive overview of lending operations and monitor loan performance categorized by 'Loan Status'. This grid view provides insights into metrics such as Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, Total Amount Received, MTD Funded Amount, MTD Amount Received, Average Interest Rate, and Average DTI.

### Dashboard 2: Overview

1. **Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart):** Identify seasonality and long-term trends in lending activities.
2. **Regional Analysis by State (Filled Map):** Identify regions with significant lending activity and assess regional disparities.
3. **Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart):** Understand the distribution of loans across various term lengths.
4. **Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart):** Assess how lending metrics are distributed among borrowers with different employment lengths.
5. **Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart):** Provide a visual breakdown of loan metrics based on stated purposes of loans.
6. **Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map):** View how home ownership impacts loan applications and disbursements hierarchically.

### Dashboard 3: Details

#### Objective:

The Details Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of key loan-related metrics and data points, facilitating efficient access to critical information about loan portfolios, borrower profiles, and loan performance.

#### Dataset Used:

The bank loan analysis dataset comprises essential fields such as Loan ID, Address State, Purpose, Grade, Sub Grade, Annual Income, Loan Status, Last Payment Date, Verification Status, Debt-to-Income Ratio, and Interest Rates. These fields provide insights into borrower demographics, employment stability, loan characteristics, risk assessment, and payment behavior.

#### Conclusion:

The Details Dashboard streamlines access to critical loan data, facilitating informed decision-making, enhancing operational efficiency, optimizing lending strategies, mitigating risks, and maximizing overall performance.
